		</h2>
		<p class="text-bold text-light-green padding-left-5 padding-right-5">The US National Toxicology Program (NTP) has recently developed a crucial tool for clinicians and toxicologists alike called Integrated Chemical Environment (ICE). ICE is a central access point for toxicology references and for model predictions to a given substance or hazard. This tool allows robust scientific exploration of the interactions of various substances and can be used for exploratory purposes as well as predictive or confirming needs.
</p>
		<p class="padding-left-5 padding-right-5">
Notably, ICE looks to implement a clinical tool called IVIVE. In-vivo-to-in-vitro extrapolation (IVIVE) is a predictive computational tool that enables analyses of substances and interactions from the womb to after birth. This tool can be used for a variety of critical functions past the obvious ones for neonatologists and obstetricians. Linking in vitro activity to in vivo exposures and outcomes can help toxicologists and physicians understand the pathways that drugs take and improve patient outcomes for those of all ages.

		</p>
		<p class="padding-left-5 padding-right-5">
The US NTP hopes to include tutorials and tools to enable people of all skill levels and backgrounds to use ICE. The tutorials should include simple answers to frequently-asked questions, guides on how to use various models, and other easily-digestible learning tools. These resources are currently under development. The US NTP predicts a 2018 launch date.
