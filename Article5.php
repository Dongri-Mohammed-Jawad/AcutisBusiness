		<p class="text-bold text-light-green padding-left-5 padding-right-5">In April of this year, Wright State University, Ohio was the staging ground for equipping healthcare students to better handle the opioid crisis. A coalition of various local activism and healthcare improvement groups assembled an event to train more than 40 aspiring professionals about how to use naloxone. The group included medical students, healthcare-related undergraduate students, pharmaceutical students, and physician assistant students.

Naloxone, the opioid antagonist used to block the effects of opioids notably in formulations such as Suboxone, has become ubiquitous in the fight against opioid overdose. Law enforcement and other emergency response forces have even begun to train to use it. Naloxone is a critical part of the opioid-dependence treatment. When bundled with buprenorphine in Suboxone, it acts to deter abuse of the opioid while ensuring that the patient does not undergo withdrawal.

The opioid crisis is critically important to healthcare providers today. The CDC reports that 91 Americans die every single day from opioid overdose, including from prescription drugs. Training health practitioners to be able to respond to this is crucial in preventing unnecessary death and getting the proper treatment to these patients.
